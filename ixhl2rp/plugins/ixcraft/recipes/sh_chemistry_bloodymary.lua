RECIPE.description = "A local Chem that has only recently started circulating in Mesquite. It seems to be a Psycho derivative, causing mind numbing fits of rage for users, but has the side effects of uncontrollable sudden and jerky movements along with minor respiratory bleeding, from which its name comes from. Itâ€™s often used as a cheaper alternative to the real stuff by low lifes."
