From the dawn of man, many folks even in the old times knew the importance of Herbs
its applications vary nowdays as the fauna of the wastelands has drasticly been altered
due to radiation exposure. Still with few steps you too will know how to carefully remove
and prepare materials found out there.

Xander roots are bulbous plants that have plenty of medical applications, to properly remove one make sure to dig around
the root first before uprooting it using the stem above it. After the root is removed from the ground
inspect it for any signs of breaks in the outer layer, if the interior is damaged and dried its medical applications are much
smaller in scope in comparison to a ripe one

Broc flowers are thin yet durable plants that bloom within the warmer seasons of the year. To remove the flower carefully cut at the
base avoiding damaging any of the petals as dried broc flowers suffer from the same issue as Xander roots do.

Nettle and mint can be diffrenciated between the fact that wild mint has less small thorns around the stem and it does not cause
any irritation upon touch. Nettle leaves can be touched without irritation as long as its on the upper part of the leaf
underside of many leaves posses tiny needles which cause a burning feeling. In both cases use gloves and grab it at the base of the stem
or cut about 3cm from the ground

Aloe vera has a similar apperance to agave, in order to harvest it correcly make an incision into the leaf. If the inside has a white layer and posseses a 
slighly sweet smell. Youve found the right one.

Applications

First of all, aloe vera. Its looks and uses have not been affected much since the fall of 
the old world. In order to make a disinfectant salve youll need 8oz. of herbal oil which can be
made with olive oil and mixture of rosemarry, nettle and camomile. Using a pot pour the oil
and add beeswax, not a lot. 1 oz. of it should be enough. When its ready add crushed aloe vera plant and mix 
untill you have a thick consistency. Colour should have a tinge of green. When the salve is completed
it should be applied onto clean bandages to prevent bacterial infections from exposure to sweat.

Second is what is known as tribal tincture. While the use and the recipy for tincture is for most people
common knownlege, this version is diffrent. As it utilizes xander root. Procure a bottle of spirits
preferably high in alcohol like absinthe or moonshine. utilize wild mint, grated barrel cactus, camomile and nettle and cut everything finely.
Then proceed to boil quatered xander root before adding the herbs. The boiling of the alcohol should not be done for too long about 10 minutes 
should be good enough for the alcohol seep into the herbs and the root. Afterwards pour the mixture into a mason jar and store in a dry, shaded place.
After a month the mixture should be good to go. It is a perfect mixture to clean bandages with or use while suffering from common cold or flu.

Third is a broc flower ginger shot. In the wasteland sometimes it's difficult to find anything to improve your immune system. Tribes from the canyons
have been using grated ginger and broc flower powder which is attained when using pestle and mortar with flour to intergrate into the flour. 
Afterwards the two ingridients should be mixed together in a jar, and use 1 oz. for a tea when feeling under the weather.
