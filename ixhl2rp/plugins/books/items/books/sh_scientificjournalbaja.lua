<font color='green' size='6'>The Wastes of Baja</font>
<font color='grey' size='4'>Ron Kingsley</font>

Territories of Baja that border our lands have been an
intresting point of contention in NCR politics but why
is that? We will be giving an overlook as to what makes
this patch of land a good candidacy for the next new state
in the federation of the NCR.

We should begin with the orgins of Baja. As a state with
a rich hispanic background both historically and ethnically
after the fall of the old world America has seen a rise of
numerous gangs that fought for control. While Shady sands
had its own gripes with raider gangs. What we are talking
about are more akin to crime families of new Reno. 
With offers of community and safety under the watchful 
eyes of the local familias. The Rivera family being the 
smallest on the list. Composed of people pushing forward
the idea of agriculture for medicinal needs through cultivation
of Aloe vera in the arid lands. This choice alongside a vast
production of tequilla allowed the family with the acess to the
sea to become a trading barony with supplies to other familias
fortifying their position both from a political standpoint
and security one. The people serving under the familia are 
conservative folk so their need for faith was preserved as 
Rivea attempted to reconstruct much of abbeys and churches
within their territory to appease the people and fortify loyality
for the familia. Despite this they had no luck enticing others 
to their cause.

Second notable familia on the list is the Dominiguez which 
served as a spearhead with mexican influence for its domestic
arms manufacturing and development. Theyve stayed close to 
the tradition of pistoleros making majority of their arms 
in the revolver and 1800s rifle calibers. It is said that 
their craftsmanship was for some time enjoyed by select few
in Arizona, before legion took its hold there. 
Despite being held together by a strict rule, the locals of
the territories enjoyed a strong national identity and seen 
themselves as true people of Baja. Which gave way for the 
familia to also establish its own fleet protecting and 
serving as a negotiation strong arm of its people when it 
comes to dealing with merchants from beyond.
Alongside rapid industrialization theyve also managed to supply
its people with plenty of clean water, something that NCR has
not been able to enforce on a large scale.

Still that did not come without tries and tribulations
many years ago the territories of the Dominigues were hit
with a large cholera outbreak which spread rapidly through the 
region. Rivera at that time barred anyone from entering their 
lands even for something simple as seeking refuge from the 
diesease. At that time the Dominiguez despite their strong 
anti NCR sentiment were forced to accept envoys passing through
Cano familia lands. Which were only allowed after giving a portion 
of its arms away to them. With this scolars and doctors assisted
its people in combating the diesease. Saving the lands and by
extension the NCR itself from a plauge. This gave the NCR upper 
hand in negotiations in the future.

Note
We also asked for comment on this part of history from a prominent 
and respected individual in the scienticic and medical community
Dr Holiday but he refused to make a statement out of the respect of 
the people of Baja.

Finally the affrementioned Cano familia. With their territories 
bordering our own for the longest time we had problems as they did 
not adapt the same way others of their peers did. Cano rose to 
power through utilizing the desperation of its people and promises
of loot by raiding the lands of the NCR and extorting caravans that 
dared to come close to baja and its people. They were the familia
composed of strongest and most expirenced gunslingers which 
gave them an upper hand in the part of the region. 
Still that came to and end after a reformer second son of the Cano,
Emil Cano. The raider mentality of the family came to and end.
In the years of him assuming control after a coup the family instead
of utilizing brawn, instead turned to reporpousing pre war tech 
to maintain its security. Reactivating old world garrison 
robots to help them with strong arming the merchants without 
having to fight personally to send a clear message.

Eventually baja with the push of the Dominiguez familia have convinced
the Cano family to allow NCR to establish an embassy within its capital
this gave ground work to allow independant groups within the NCR to 
start initiatives to improve the lands of Baja winning over its people.
Improvements in agriculture further and better medical understanding 
under the watchful eye of the followers of the apocalypse allowed Baja
to bloom into a centre of trade and cultivation. Still it is very 
much apparent that theres still a long way for Baja to become part of
the NCR with its familias holding strong onto the idea of independance.
It remains to be seen if given enough time and paitience they can be 
convinced to join as a administrative territory for now.
