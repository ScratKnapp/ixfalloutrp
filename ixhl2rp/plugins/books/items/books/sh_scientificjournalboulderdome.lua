<font color='green' size='6'>The Expedition into the Boulder Dome</font>
<font color='grey' size='4'>Richard Keys</font>

We have all heard the tale of the fabled Boggard and the baggers.
Greatest minds of the NCR embarking on an expedition deep into
colorado in order to find technology to save the union.
I think we can all agree that Kimball while a great leader is 
not true representative of NCRs values. With time our core idea
and values eroded by an imperialist approach. Why Boggard left?

Thats a very easy answer for those who were there to witness it 
to answer. As for you dear reader its a complex answer.
While of course main goal was for scientific reasons, Boggard 
and his personal politics played a role in this.
Many in the scientific community are able to agree that NCR
for quite a while has been distancing itself from intelectualist
spirit that we fostered for years. Distancing ourselves from 
values of Vault city and the Shi. This struck a cord with Boggard
who voiced his conserns many times only to be shut down by 
political lobbysts in the scientific community. 

As such Boggard had no option but to seek a way to expand knownlege
of the NCR in a proper envoirment, without politics or war.
Hence why old military documents arose that provided Boggard with a 
rough location of the Boulder Dome. Boggard made the decision to 
embark as soon as he was ready. He went East taking along him many of
his collegues alongside trusted guards that were on board with his 
ideas.

As to what became of the expedition? Its been multiple years with no
signs of life, leading many to conclue that Boggard blinded by his 
urge to fix what could not be easly done so. Went on a fools errand.
Getting himself and his companions killed. That is what most say.

Though there few ones unconvinced. That still hold the belief that 
Boggard is still out there, working quietly for the sake of the 
NCR waiting to return when the country will change for the better
to accept his ideas with open arms and not exploit them for war.

Still until we find real evidence to back this theory up. 
We must be realistic in calling the expedition a faliure.
Still it is up to you dear reader to make your own truth of 
what was provided today.
