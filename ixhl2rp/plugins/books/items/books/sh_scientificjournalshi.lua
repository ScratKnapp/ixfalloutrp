For majority of us, we dont really dwell on the past or rich history
of our neighbors. We would like to change that to more intellectually 
inclined readers out there. As many of us in the scientific community
are in awe of the technological wonders of the Shi. Where this old
world greatness truly originate from?

In order to find that out we traveled to the wonderful city of San
Francisco and spoke to its elders to have a glimpse into its customs
Based on their accounts, a very long time ago. Crew of a chinese 
submarine docked in the city after the bombs fell. The crew seeing
the destruction, abandoned their ideals of continuing to fight the war
as if it is like this here, in their eyes it was most likely like it 
was at home. Theyve cooperated with the local surviviors to restore glory
to the old city. Turning it over time into what we know as the San
Francisco of post war america. Before the bombs fell there was plenty of
asian influence within architecture of the streets. Something that served
as a benefit to the newfound owners of the city. Still it did not come
without issues. The newcommers had to learn and adapt to the common 
language of the locals in order to efficiently protect them as well
as continue the reconstruction of the community. While under Communist
rule it was not seen kindly to foster spiritual belief, the crew 
belived that the good spirits of the past can be enticed with offerings
to bring good luck, creating a space for cultural boom as shrines were 
established.

We can say that their efforts to appease the spirits worked in the favour
of the current day Shi as it is a highly visited trading hub, but that is
not the only thing that allowed Shi to prosper, based on the knownlege of 
the old world, through passages in illegal books that we were able to obtain
China in its times of the feudal years has been a point of creation for 
nummerous inventions we know today, from the invention of gunpowder to 
improvements and continues expansion of medical knownlege, and that is 
exacly what allowed it to prosper despite countless war. This innovaitve 
spirit has remained within the decendants of the chinese folk as 
new inventions were introduced and a scientific community has been fostered
for improvement of lives that reside within the territories of Shi and beyond

Still what is the only thing to mourn about our asiatic friends that the 
freedom their attained was only allowed to be because of the assured 
destruction of both the old world America and China. Their ideals and 
unity would not survive under the law of their own motherland. As Communism
has a tendency to not only control work and its people but also belief 
and thought. So we are thankful that the crew that begun as outsiders to our
lands chose peace in order to preserve their culture and allow freedom for 
their people to prosper once more under a new banner.
