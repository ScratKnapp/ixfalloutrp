ITEM.longdesc = "During the NCR's war against the Brotherhood, a fair chunk of T-45 suits were recovered from slain foes. Some intact, most not. Due to the difficulty of restoring suits, training troopers in their use, and keeping up maintinence, most were stripped of servos to be worn as traditional armor. The result is almost as protective, but incredibly heavy."
